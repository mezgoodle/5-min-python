# 5-min-python

One day I saw this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFzNc7D44HI). So i code and pushed to GitHub. Here you are.

You can find three simple, but useful programs:

- [driver.py](https://github.com/mezgoodle/5-min-python/blob/master/driver.py). You can use it for transfer files with needed extension to another space automatically.

- [server.py](https://github.com/mezgoodle/5-min-python/blob/master/server.py). Only four lines of code and you have live server on Python.

- [selenium.py](https://github.com/mezgoodle/5-min-python/blob/master/selenium.py). You can open link in internet and read all information from webpage.
